# PhoneDialer2

This is just piecing together different things. 

At first you see nothing but a contacts and a call button

click contacts then pick one and pick the number then you segue back to the app and press call. Of course I will make this all nice 
looking. But my head hurts only getting this far. tel:// 

To explain there is a call i have to make daily and have to hit redial over and over and over again. takes about 20 -30 minutes to get through. 
So this is the beginning of the workings of that. 

I connect to my apps -- it pulls up picker -- i click the name phone number comes up I choose that. Saves in to variable: numberToDial 

had some problems getting openURL to take it because of the dashes. might have been the version of xCode i was on I don't know.

Note that this has been a very long process for me. With work and other stuff. Yet it is so simple looking at it now. 

steps I want to make

1. how many time to attempt redial
2. seconds in between redial
3. if gets connected then end app else redial
